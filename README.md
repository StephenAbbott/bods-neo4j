# BODS-Neo4j

Bidirectional converter between the [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (BODS) v0.4](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.4.0/) and [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph database, with built-in graph analysis queries for UBO detection, corporate group mapping, and circular ownership detection.

Part of the [BODS Interoperability Toolkit](https://github.com/StephenAbbott/bods-interoperability-toolkit).

## Why?

**BODS** provides a universal, standardised format for beneficial ownership data — enabling interoperability across countries, registers, and data sources. **Neo4j** provides powerful graph traversal and analysis capabilities that are essential for understanding complex ownership structures.

This tool bridges the gap:

- **BODS → Neo4j**: Import any BODS v0.4 dataset into Neo4j for graph analysis, UBO detection, and visualisation
- **Neo4j → BODS**: Export graph data back to BODS format for standardised data exchange and sharing
- **Graph Queries**: Ready-made Cypher queries for common beneficial ownership analysis tasks

## Background

The [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](https://standard.openownership.org/) was created by [Open Ownership](https://www.openownership.org/) as the world's leading open standard for beneficial ownership information on legal persons and legal arrangements.

BODS data is published by multiple sources including:
- [BODS Data Explorer](https://bods-data.openownership.org/) — GLEIF and other datasets in BODS format
- [UK PSC Pipeline](https://github.com/openownership/bods-uk-psc-pipeline) — UK Companies House data
- [GLEIF Pipeline](https://github.com/openownership/bods-gleif-pipeline) — Legal Entity Identifiers
- [OpenCorporates Pipeline](https://github.com/StephenAbbott/bods-opencorporates) — OpenCorporates relationship data
- [Kyckr Pipeline](https://github.com/StephenAbbott/bods-kyckr) — Kyckr UBO verification data
- [ICIJ Offshore Leaks Pipeline](https://github.com/StephenAbbott/bods-icij-offshoreleaks) — Offshore Leaks Database

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

For development:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Start Neo4j

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts Neo4j Community Edition on `bolt://localhost:7687` with APOC plugin.

### 2. BODS → Neo4j (CSV export)

Generate Neo4j-importable CSV files and import scripts:

```bash
bods-neo4j to-csv examples/sample_data/sample_bods.json -o ./neo4j_export
```

This produces:
- One CSV per node label (`entity.csv`, `person.csv`, `identifier.csv`, `address.csv`, `country.csv`, `unspecified_party.csv`)
- One CSV per relationship type (`owns.csv`, `controls.csv`, `manages.csv`, `is_party_to.csv`, `has_other_interest.csv`, `has_identifier.csv`, `has_address.csv`, `located_in.csv`, `registered_in.csv`, `born_in.csv`)
- `import.cypher` — `LOAD CSV` script for a running Neo4j instance (includes constraints + entity subtype-label fixups)
- `import.sh` — convenience wrapper that pipes `import.cypher` through `cypher-shell`

### 3. BODS → Neo4j (direct driver load)

Load BODS data directly into Neo4j:

```bash
bods-neo4j to-neo4j examples/sample_data/sample_bods.json \
    --uri bolt://localhost:7687 \
    --username neo4j \
    --password bodspassword
```

### 4. Neo4j → BODS

Export the graph back to BODS format:

```bash
bods-neo4j to-bods output.jsonl \
    --uri bolt://localhost:7687 \
    --username neo4j \
    --password bodspassword \
    --publisher-name "My Organisation"
```

### 5. Inspect data

```bash
# BODS file statistics
bods-neo4j info examples/sample_data/sample_bods.json

# Neo4j graph statistics
bods-neo4j graph-info --uri bolt://localhost:7687 --username neo4j --password bodspassword
```

## Neo4j Graph Schema

The model is graph-native: things BODS treats as identities (identifiers, addresses, jurisdictions) are first-class nodes, and the generic interest edge splits into a 5-family taxonomy. Each BODS interest in a relationship statement becomes one typed edge carrying the interest payload directly — no intermediate `:Interest` node.

### Nodes

| Label | BODS source | Key | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `:Entity` (+ subtype labels: `RegisteredEntity` / `LegalEntity` / `Arrangement` / `Trust` / `Nomination` / `StateBody` / …) | entity statement | `recordId` | Inline statement metadata (statementId, publicationDate, publisherName, source*, annotation*). |
| `:Person` | person statement | `recordId` | Nationalities / tax residencies as inline parallel-list properties (`nationalityCodes`, `nationalityNames`). |
| `:Identifier` | `identifiers[]` (entity / person) | `uid` = `scheme\|id` | Deduplicated globally — the same Companies-House ID is one node across all statements that reference it. |
| `:Address` | `addresses[]` (entity / person) | `uid` = sha256(normalised content) | The BODS address `type` lives on the `[:HAS_ADDRESS {type, ordinal}]` edge so the same address can play multiple roles. |
| `:Country` | entity jurisdiction + address country leg | `code` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) | Shared dedup point. Nationality / tax residency stay inline on `:Person`. |
| `:UnspecifiedParty` | inline `unspecifiedReason` party object (subject or interestedParty) | `uid` = `statementId:side` | Sentinel — preserves BODS's inline-unspecified shape when there is no recordId to anchor the typed edge to. |

### Relationships

```
(party:Person|Entity)-[:OWNS|CONTROLS|MANAGES|IS_PARTY_TO|HAS_OTHER_INTEREST {…interest payload + statement metadata}]->(subject:Entity|Person)
(:Entity|:Person)-[:HAS_IDENTIFIER {ordinal, isPrimary}]->(:Identifier)
(:Entity|:Person)-[:HAS_ADDRESS {type, ordinal}]->(:Address)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Country)
(:Entity)-[:REGISTERED_IN]->(:Country)
(:Person)-[:BORN_IN]->(:Address)
(:Entity|:Person)-[:REPLACES]->(same-label)
```

A BODS relationship statement with N interests in its `interests[]` array becomes N parallel typed edges between the same (party, subject) pair. Every edge carries the statement-level metadata (`statementId`, `recordId`, `publicationDate`, `publisherName`, `sourceTypes`, …) duplicated, plus the per-interest payload (`bodsInterestType`, `family`, `shareExact/Min/Max`, `directOrIndirect`, `beneficialOwnershipOrControl`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `details`). The reverse mapper groups edges by `statementId` and sorts by `interestIndex` to rebuild a single BODS statement.

The 23 BODS interest types collapse into five Cypher relationship-type families for fast traversal selectivity; the original interest type is preserved verbatim as `bodsInterestType` on each edge so the round-trip is lossless.

| Family | BODS interest types covered |
|---|---|
| `OWNS` | shareholding, rightsToProfitOrIncome, rightsToSurplusAssetsOnDissolution, rightToProfitOrIncomeFromAssets, enjoymentAndUseOfAssets, rightsGrantedByContract, conditionalRightsGrantedByContract |
| `CONTROLS` | votingRights, controlViaCompanyRulesOrArticles, controlByLegalFramework, otherInfluenceOrControl, appointmentOfBoard |
| `MANAGES` | seniorManagingOfficial, boardMember, boardChair |
| `IS_PARTY_TO` | settlor, trustee, protector, beneficiaryOfLegalArrangement, nominee, nominator |
| `HAS_OTHER_INTEREST` | unknownInterest, unpublishedInterest, plus any forward-compat values |

### Round-Trip Fidelity

The reverse mapper rebuilds `identifiers` / `addresses` by aggregating their related graph nodes, and rebuilds `interests[]` by grouping typed edges that share a `statementId` and sorting by `interestIndex`. No `*_json` blobs on nodes or edges. Any publisher-specific or forward-compat fields the structured extraction does not recognise are preserved verbatim in a single `extrasJson` catch-all per node / first edge. Data can be converted back to valid BODS v0.4 format without loss.

## Graph Analysis Queries

### Python API

```python
from bods_neo4j.config import Neo4jConfig
from bods_neo4j.graph_queries.ubo_detection import find_owners, find_all_ubos
from bods_neo4j.graph_queries.corporate_groups import find_corporate_group, find_top_level_parents
from bods_neo4j.graph_queries.circular_ownership import find_circular_ownership

config = Neo4jConfig(uri="bolt://localhost:7687", username="neo4j", password="bodspassword")

# Find all owners of an entity
owners = find_owners("rec-entity-alpha", config)

# Find all UBOs with >= 25% effective ownership
ubos = find_all_ubos(config, threshold=25.0)

# Map a corporate group
group = find_corporate_group("rec-entity-alpha", config)

# Find top-level parent entities
parents = find_top_level_parents(config, limit=50)

# Detect circular ownership
cycles = find_circular_ownership(config)
```

### Key Cypher Queries

With BODS interests carried directly on the typed edge, ownership chains are single-hop variable-length traversals.

**Find all owners of an entity:**
```cypher
MATCH path = (owner)-[:OWNS|CONTROLS*1..10]->(target:Entity {recordId: "rec-entity-alpha"})
WHERE owner:Person OR
      (owner:Entity AND NOT EXISTS { ()-[:OWNS|CONTROLS]->(owner) })
RETURN owner.name, length(path) AS depth,
       [r IN relationships(path) | r.bodsInterestType] AS interestTypes
```

**Calculate effective ownership through chains:**
```cypher
MATCH path = (person:Person)-[:OWNS*1..10]->(entity:Entity)
WITH person, entity, path,
     reduce(pct = 1.0, r IN relationships(path) |
         CASE WHEN r.shareMinimum IS NOT NULL
              THEN pct * (toFloat(r.shareMinimum) / 100.0)
              ELSE pct END) * 100.0 AS effectivePct
WHERE effectivePct >= 25
RETURN person.name, entity.name, effectivePct
```

**Detect circular ownership:**
```cypher
MATCH path = (e:Entity)-[:OWNS|CONTROLS*2..10]->(e)
RETURN e.name, length(path) AS cycleLength,
       [n IN nodes(path) | n.name] AS cycleNames
```

**Find entities without identified UBOs:**
```cypher
MATCH (e:Entity)
WHERE EXISTS { ()-[:OWNS|CONTROLS]->(e) }
  AND NOT EXISTS { (:Person)-[:OWNS|CONTROLS*1..20]->(e) }
RETURN e.name, head([(e)-[:REGISTERED_IN]->(c:Country) | c.code]) AS jurisdictionCode
```

## Comparison with Other Approaches

This tool was designed by comparing two approaches to modelling UK beneficial ownership data:

| Approach | Open Ownership ([bods-uk-psc-pipeline](https://github.com/openownership/bods-uk-psc-pipeline)) | Neo4j Team ([neo4j-company-house-demo](https://github.com/erikbijl/neo4j-company-house-demo)) |
|---|---|---|
| **Output** | Standardised BODS v0.4 JSON | Custom Neo4j property graph |
| **Strength** | Interoperability across data sources | Graph traversal and UBO analysis |
| **Weakness** | No graph analysis built in | Source-specific, not interoperable |

**BODS-Neo4j bridges this gap** — standardised data format with graph analysis capabilities.

## Testing

```bash
pytest
```

Tests cover:
- BODS file reading (JSON and JSONL)
- Statement mapping (entities, persons, relationships)
- CSV export with correct structure
- Round-trip fidelity (BODS → Neo4j → BODS)
- BODS schema utilities

### Conformance against the shared BODS v0.4 fixture pack

`tests/test_bods_fixtures_conformance.py` runs the mapper against every case in the canonical [**bods-v04-fixtures**](https://pypi.org/project/bods-v04-fixtures/) pack via the [**pytest-bods-v04-fixtures**](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-bods-v04-fixtures/) plugin. Tests are parametrized by fixture name so a failure like `[edge-cases/10-circular-ownership]` points straight at the offending case.

Graph-specific conformance checks include: every statement maps to a node or relationship (no silent `None` returns from shape divergence); circular ownership emits two distinct mirrored HAS_INTEREST edges; and declared-unknown UBOs (inline `unspecifiedReason`) don't crash the mapper and still leave the known subject entity as a usable node.
